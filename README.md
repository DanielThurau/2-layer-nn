# 2-Layer Neural Network

Two basic Neural Network classifier models used in the [Deep Learning Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) course. The `model.py` was the one developed in the course, while the `cat_model.py` was my attempt to extend what I learned to classify other images like cats.
